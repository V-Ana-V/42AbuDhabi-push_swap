## Plan (Mandatory part)

1) We should transform char arguments to numbers (with function ft_atoi)
2) Then we will put arguments in stack a
   Stacks will be 2 linked lists
3) We should write functions to recreate operations on stacks (8 operations: sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr)
4) We should perform the sorting algorithm itself in main
